  <p>
    Here I will slowly add notes while teaching that I hope are of some use to the students.
    Notes are taken from the material of their assigned textbook to maintain consistency, but
    I will introduce my own metaphors and informal thoughts on the physics. This is in hopes the
    material is seen in multiple ways and more importantly, is played with to encourage creative
    thought around physics instead of rigid procedures already exhausted by the course and books.
